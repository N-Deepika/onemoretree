# Theme Of The Project
## Environment and Climate change
Climate change is an ongoing problem with our planet, so we want to tackle this issue we came up with this innovative solutions.

# Inspiration
Our carbon emissions must be drastically reduced to prevent the most dangerous effects of climate change. And how do we do that? By planting trees. One tree can sequester more than one ton of carbon dioxide in its lifetime. Our goal is to simplify the process so everyone can contribute, from individuals/volunteers to nurseries and companies alike, to help save the earth. According to facts, we still need to plant 8 million trees per year upto 20 years to save our planet, and we together can achieve this if we all play our roles in it and be a responsible earthling.

# How it works
Is getting outside and physically planting a tree not an option for you? Do you still want to do something? OneMoreTree has some great and easy steps for you to follow. You just have to go about and select a tree and get your saplings into the earth. This initiative works with people whose business deals with trees and plantations. Contributors can pick the type of tree they want, from Neem to Eucalyptus,we have a long list of distributors listed with us and you just have to place an order. Following that , those orders will be forwarded to the other trees selling businesses and other small scale planters who acts like a distributor for us. But thats not only it, we also give a plateform to the young climate enthusiasts to lend their hand in saving the Earth, promote them by providing a leaderboard and prizes for the top saviours and also contribute to other initiatives working towards saving the world with the help of a bit of margin we are keeping in the model.

# What are the features
We plan to organise various events on our plateform as well as promote climate awareness among the youngsters and providing them a plateform to showcase their contributions and contribute to the environment. Small scale businesses can connect with us and enlist their trees and contributors can donate and plant their trees of their choice or can themselves go outside and plant a sapling and enlist themselves on the leaderboard of our website.

# Progress Report
We've completely designed and completed the backend of the project and have a working flow of the plateform, we are yet to connect the complete backend with frontend, few functionalities like the dashboard feature and payment integration is pending.
